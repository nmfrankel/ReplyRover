TEXTBACK FEE - AS OF MARCH

For 17 years, we've provided zmanim texts FREE for Yidden across the world - and that makes us happy!

Due to ever-rising costs of commercial texting (as well as the service's booming popularity!), we are no longer able to continue offering Textback as a free service.

We're so sorry!

As of March 2023, this service costs $9 for a full year of texts. To pay (credit card only), call 516-261-6230.

If you don't want to pay $9 per year, you can still get zmanim FREE by calling our infoline 516-796-2646, by visiting our website MyZmanim.com, or by launching our mobile app - anytime.

If you have any questions, please text us at (516) 261-6700. We're here to help you serve Hashem - and we love hearing from you!
